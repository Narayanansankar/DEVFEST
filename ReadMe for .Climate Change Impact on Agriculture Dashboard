Description: 
           Climate change significantly affects global agriculture by altering temperature patterns, precipitation 
levels, and the frequency of extreme weather events. These changes impact crop yields, soil health, and 
irrigation needs, affecting food security and farming sustainability. This dataset is designed to help 
researchers, data scientists, and policymakers analyze how climate variations influence agricultural 
productivity across different regions. 

Columns: 

  Region – Simulated geographic region 
  Year – Modeled year of data collection 
  Average_Temperature – Simulated temperature levels (°C) 
  Precipitation – Modeled annual rainfall (mm) 
  Crop_Yield – Synthetic yield data for selected crops (tons/hectare) 
  Extreme_Weather_Events – Number of modeled extreme weather occurrences per year 

Analysis question: 

1)How does an increase in average temperature affect crop yield across different regions 
        Examine whether higher temperatures correlate with lower crop yields and identify regions most 
    affected by rising temperatures. 
2)What is the impact of annual precipitation levels on crop yield trends? 
       Investigate whether regions with higher or lower precipitation levels experience significant changes in 
    crop productivity. 
3)Is there a correlation between extreme weather events and crop yield decline? 
      Analyze whether an increase in extreme weather events (such as droughts or floods) results in a 
    significant decrease in agricultural output. 
4)Which regions are most vulnerable to climate change based on extreme weather frequency and crop 
yield trends? 
      Identify regions that experience frequent extreme weather events and assess their impact on food 
    security. 
5)How do variations in climate factors (temperature, precipitation, extreme weather events) 
  collectively influence agricultural productivity over time? 
      Use time-series analysis to determine whether climate changes over the years have had a cumulative 
  effect on crop production.
