Description: 
      This dataset helps in identifying potential COVID-19 cases based on key symptoms, contact 
history, and severity levels. The dataset includes information on patient demographics, symptom occurrence, 
and severity classification, which can be useful for predicting risk levels and understanding the spread of the 
disease. 

Dataset Name: covid_19.csv

Columns in the Dataset: 
  • Country – List of countries the person has visited. 
  • Age – Classification of the age group based on WHO standards. 
  • Symptoms – Major symptoms: Fever, Tiredness, Difficulty in breathing, Dry cough, and Sore throat. 
  • Additional Symptoms – Other symptoms: Body pains, Nasal congestion, Runny nose, Diarrhea, and 
  Others. 
  • Severity – Categorized into Mild, Moderate, or Severe cases. 
  • Contact – Whether the person had contact with a COVID-19 patient. 

Analysis Questions: 

1. Which age group is most affected by severe COVID-19 cases? 
    Analyze the severity levels across different age groups using a bar chart to understand which age 
group is at higher risk. 

2. Which symptom is most commonly reported across different countries? 
    Aggregate the occurrence of each symptom by country and visualize it using a heatmap or bar chart 
to identify global symptom trends. 

3. How does contact history influence the severity of COVID-19 symptoms? 
    Compare the severity levels between those who had contact with COVID-19 patients and those who 
didn't, using a comparative analysis. 

4. Which combination of symptoms is most likely to result in severe cases? 
    Use clustering techniques or association rule mining to find symptom patterns linked to severe 
COVID-19 cases. 

5. Which country has the highest percentage of high-risk cases (severe symptoms and contact 
history)? 
    Identify high-risk regions by analyzing the overlap between severe cases and individuals with a 
known contact history.
