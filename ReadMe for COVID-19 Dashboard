Analysis Questions: 

1.Which countries have the highest active cases?
      Use a bar chart to visualize countries with the highest number of active cases and compare them with the total confirmed cases.
2.What is the death-to-recovery ratio across different countries?
      Analyze the ratio of deaths to recoveries using a scatter plot to identify countries where the fatality rate is significantly higher.
3.Which WHO region has the fastest-growing COVID-19 cases?
      Use a line graph to track the percentage increase in confirmed cases over the past week across different WHO regions.
4.What is the relationship between case increase and mortality rate?
      Compare the percentage increase in cases with the corresponding rise in deaths using a correlation heatmap.
5.Which countries are experiencing the highest weekly case growth?
      Use a map visualization to highlight countries where the number of confirmed cases has increased the most in the last week.
